IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
MHRA/CHM ADVICE (UPDATED APRIL 2016): RISK OF DIABETIC
KETOACIDOSIS WITH SODIUM-GLUCOSE CO-TRANSPORTER 2
(SGLT2) INHIBITORS (CANAGLIFLOZIN, DAPAGLIFLOZIN OR
EMPAGLIFLOZIN)
A review by the European Medicines Agency has
concluded that serious, life-threatening, and fatal cases
of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been reported rarely
in patients taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. In several cases,
the presentation of DKA was atypical with patients
having only moderately elevated blood glucose levels,
and some of them occurred during off-label use.
To minimise the risk of such effects when treating
patients with a SGLT2 inhibitor, the European Medicines
Agency has issued the following advice:
. inform patients of the signs and symptoms of DKA,
(including rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting,
abdominal pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness, a
sweet smell to the breath, a sweet or metallic taste in
the mouth, or a different odour to urine or sweat), and
advise them to seek immediate medical advice if they
develop any of these
. test for raised ketones in patients with signs and
symptoms of DKA, even if plasma glucose levels are
near-normal
. use empagliﬂozin with caution in patients with risk
factors for DKA, (including a low beta cell reserve,
conditions leading to restricted food intake or severe
dehydration, sudden reduction in insulin, increased
insulin requirements due to acute illness, surgery or
alcohol abuse), and discuss these risk factors with
patients
. discontinue treatment if DKA is suspected or
diagnosed
. do not restart treatment with any SGLT2 inhibitor in
patients who experienced DKA during use, unless
another cause for DKA was identiﬁed and resolved
. interrupt SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients who
are hospitalised for major surgery or acute serious
illnesses; treatment may be restarted once the
patient’s condition has stabilised
MHRA/CHM ADVICE: SGLT2 INHIBITORS: MONITOR KETONES IN
BLOOD DURING TREATMENT INTERRUPTION FOR SURGICAL
PROCEDURES OR ACUTE SERIOUS MEDICAL ILLNESS (MARCH
2020)
New recommendations have been issued following a
European review of peri-operative diabetic ketoacidosis
in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Healthcare
professionals are advised to monitor ketone levels
during SGLT2 inhibitor treatment interruption in
patients who have been hospitalised for major surgery or
acute serious illness— measurement of blood ketone
levels is preferred to urine. Treatment may be restarted
once ketone levels are normal and the patient’s
condition has stabilised.
MHRA/CHM ADVICE: SGLT2 INHIBITORS: REPORTS OF FOURNIER ’S
GANGRENE (NECROTISING FASCIITIS OF THE GENITALIA OR
PERINEUM) (FEBRUARY 2019)
Fournier’s gangrene, a rare but serious and potentially
life-threatening infection, has been associated with the
use of sodium-glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors. If Fournier’s gangrene is suspected, stop the
SGLT2 inhibitor and urgently start treatment (including
antibiotics and surgical debridement).
Patients should be advised to seek urgent medical
attention if they experience severe pain, tenderness,
erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area,
accompanied by fever or malaise— urogenital infection
or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis.

SULFONYLUREAS
fSulfonylureas
l DRUG ACTION The sulfonylureas act mainly by augmenting
insulin secretion and consequently are effective only when
some residual pancreatic beta-cell activity is present;
during long-term administration they also have an
extrapancreatic action.
l CONTRA-INDICATIONS Presence of ketoacidosis
l CAUTIONS Can encourage weight gain.elderly . G6PD

CAUTIONS, FURTHER INFORMATION
▶ Elderly Prescription potentially inappropriate (STOPP
criteria) if prescribed along-acting sulfonylurea (e.g.
glibenclamide, chlorpropamide, glimepiride) in type2
diabetes mellitus (risk of prolonged hypoglycaemia).
See also Prescribing in the elderly p.29.

l HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT In general, manufacturers advise
avoid in severe impairment (increased risk of
hypoglycaemia).
l RENAL IMPAIRMENT Sulfonylureas should be used with
care in those with mild to moderate renal impairment,
because of the hazard of hypoglycaemia. Care is required
to use the lowest dose that adequately controls blood
glucose. Avoid where possible in severe renal impairment.
l PATIENT AND CARER ADVICE The risk of hypoglycaemia
associated with sulfonylureas should be discussed with the
patient, especially when concomitant glucose-lowering
drugs are prescribed.
Driving and skilled tasksDrivers need to be particularly
careful to avoid hypoglycaemia and should be warned of
the problems.

treatment stopped if response is insufﬁcient.
Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as
alogliptin p.773, linagliptin p.774, sitagliptin p.776,
saxagliptin p.774, and vildagliptin p.776, do not appear to
be associated with weight gain and have less incidence of
hypoglycaemia than the sulfonylureas.
Sodium glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, such
as canagliﬂozin p.783, dapagliﬂozin p.784, empagliﬂozin
p. 786, and ertugliﬂozin p.788, in addition to lowering
blood-glucose, may promote weight loss and improve
cardiovascular outcomes in certain patients. There is greater
uncertainty around the cardiovascular beneﬁts associated
with ertugliﬂozin than there is for canagliﬂozin,
dapagliﬂozin, and empagliﬂozin. SGLT2 inhibitors are
associated with a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. For
information on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with
type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, seeDiabetic
nephropathy in Diabetic complications p.767.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such
as dulaglutide p.777, exenatide p.778, liraglutide p.779,
lixisenatide p.780, and semaglutide p.781, should be
reserved for combination therapy when other treatment
options have failed. GLP-1 receptor agonists promote weight
loss, and for some patients may improve cardiovascular
outcomes.
Drug treatment, antidiabetic drugs
g Consider rescue therapy with insulin or a sulfonylurea
for patients who become symptomatically hyperglycaemic at
any stage of treatment. Treatment should be reviewed when
blood-glucose control has been achieved.h
Initial treatment
g Standard-release metformin hydrochloride is
recommended as theﬁrst choice for initial drug treatment
for all patients, due to its positive effect on weight loss,
reduced risk of hypoglycaemic events, and the additional
long-term cardiovascular beneﬁts associated with its use.
The dose of standard-release metformin should be
increased gradually to minimise the risk of gastro-intestinal
side-effects. Modiﬁed-release metformin should be offered if
the patient experiences gastro-intestinal side-effects with
standard treatment.
In addition to metformin, patients with chronic heart
failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
should also be offered a sodium glucose co-transporter2
(SGLT2) inhibitor with proven cardiovascular beneﬁta s
initial drug treatment. An SGLT2 inhibitor should also be
considered for patients who are at high risk of developing
cardiovascular disease. Metformin should be initiatedﬁrst,
with the SGLT2 inhibitor started as soon as tolerability to
metformin is conﬁrmed. h
If metformin is contra-indicated or not tolerated, seeNon-
metformin regimensbelow.
Further treatment options
g At any stage after starting initial treatment, an SGLT2
inhibitor with proven cardiovascular beneﬁt should be
offered to patients who develop chronic heart failure or
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and
should be considered in patients who become at high risk of
developing cardiovascular disease.
If monotherapy with metformin hydrochloride p.771
(alongside modiﬁcation to diet) does not control HbA1ct o
below the agreed threshold, consider metformin
hydrochloride in combination with either a
dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, or pioglitazone
p. 791, or a sulfonylurea. A sodium glucose co-transporter2
(SGLT2) inhibitor may be considered in combination with
metformin, when sulfonylureas are contra-indicated or not
tolerated, or if the patient is at signiﬁcant risk of
hypoglycaemia or its consequences.
If dual therapy is unsuccessful, consider a triple therapy
regimen by adding in either a DPP-4 inhibitor, or
pioglitazone, or a sulfonylurea. An SGLT2 inhibitor may be
considered in the following triple therapy regimens:
. Metformin hydrochloride and a sulfonylurea, and either
canagliﬂozin p.783, dapagliﬂozin p.784, or empagliﬂozin
p. 786; or
. Metformin hydrochloride and pioglitazone, and either
canagliﬂozin or empagliﬂozin; or
. Metformin hydrochloride and a DPP-4 inhibitor and
ertugliﬂozin p.788 (only if a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone
is not appropriate).
Alternatively, if dual therapy is unsuccessful, it may be
appropriate to startinsulin-based treatment— see Drug
treatment, insulin. h
g Elderly patients or those with renal impairment are at
particular risk of hypoglycaemia; if a sulfonylurea is
indicated, a shorter-acting sulfonylurea, such as gliclazide
p.789 or tolbutamide p.790 should be prescribed.l
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists
g If triple therapy with metformin hydrochloride and two
other oral drugs is tried and is not effective, or is not
tolerated or contra-indicated, a glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) receptor agonist may be considered as part of a
triple therapy regimen by switching one of the other drugs
for a GLP-1 receptor agonist.
These should only be considered for patients who have a
BMI of35 kg/m2or above(adjusted for ethnicity)and who
also have speciﬁc psychological or medical problems
associated with obesity;or for those who have a BMIlower
than 35 kg/m2 and for whom insulin therapy would have
signiﬁcant occupational implicationsor if the weight loss
associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists would beneﬁt other
signiﬁcant obesity-related comorbidities.
GLP-1 receptor agonist therapies with proven
cardiovascular beneﬁt (such as liraglutide) should be
considered in patients with established cardiovascular
disease.
After 6 months, the GLP-1 receptor agonist should be
reviewed and only continued if there has been a beneﬁcial
metabolic response (a reduction of at least11 mmol/mol
[1.0%] in HbA1c and a weight loss of at least3% of initial
body-weight).
Insulin should only be prescribed in combination with a
GLP-1 receptor agonist under specialist care advice and with
ongoing support from a consultant-led multidisciplinary
team. h
Non-metformin regimens
g If metformin is contra-indicated or not tolerated, a
sodium glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with
proven cardiovascular beneﬁt should be offered asﬁrst-line
treatment for patients who have chronic heart failure or
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. An SGLT2
inhibitor should also be considered for patients who are at
high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
For all other patients, consider a dipeptidylpeptidase-4
(DPP-4) inhibitor, or pioglitazone, or a sulfonylurea asﬁrst-
line drug treatment if metformin is contra-indicated or not
tolerated. An SGLT2 inhibitor may be considered as an
alternative option to a DPP-4 inhibitor, if neither a
sulfonylurea or pioglitazone are appropriate.
Repaglinide p.782 is also an effective alternative option
for single therapy, but it has a limited role in treatment
because, should an intensiﬁcation of treatment be required,
it is not licensed to be used in any combination other than
with metformin hydrochloride; it would therefore require a
complete change of treatment in those patients who have
started it due to intolerance or contra-indication to
metformin. h

Papaveretum is rarely used; morphine is easier to prescribe
and less prone to error with regard to the strength and dose.
Pentazocine p.506 has both agonist and antagonist
properties and precipitates withdrawal symptoms, including
pain in patients dependent on other opioids. By injection it
is more potent than dihydrocodeine tartrate p.493 or
codeine phosphate, but hallucinations and thought
disturbances may occur. It is not recommended and, in
particular, should be avoided after myocardial infarction as it
may increase pulmonary and aortic blood pressure as well as
cardiac work.
Pethidine hydrochloride p.506 produces prompt but
short-lasting analgesia; it is less constipating than
morphine, but even in high doses is a less potent analgesic.
It is not suitable for severe continuing pain. It is used for
analgesia in labour; however, other opioids, such as
morphine or diamorphine hydrochloride, are often preferred
for obstetric pain.
Tapentadol p.507 produces analgesia by two mechanisms.
It is an opioid-receptor agonist and it also inhibits
noradrenaline reuptake. Nausea, vomiting, and constipation
are less likely to occur with tapentadol than with other
strong opioid analgesics.
Tramadol hydrochloride p.508 produces analgesia by two
mechanisms: an opioid effect and an enhancement of
serotonergic and adrenergic pathways. It has fewer of the
typical opioid side-effects (notably, less respiratory
depression, less constipation and less addiction potential);
psychiatric reactions have been reported.
Weak opioids
Codeine phosphate can be used for the relief of mild to
moderate pain where other painkillers such as paracetamol
or ibuprofen p.1256 have proved ineffective.
Dihydrocodeine tartrate has an analgesic efﬁcacy similar
to that of codeine phosphate. Higher doses may provide
some additional pain relief but this may be at the cost of
more nausea and vomiting.
Meptazinol p.500 is claimed to have a low incidence of
repiratory depression. It has a reported length of action of
2 to 7 hours with onset within15 minutes.
Postoperative analgesia
g Offer a multimodal approach using a combination of
analgesics from different classes to manage postoperative
pain.hFor further information on postoperative
analgesia, see Peri-operative analgesia p.1478. The use of
intra-operative opioids affects the prescribing of
postoperative analgesics. A postoperative opioid analgesic
should be given with care since it may potentiate any
residual respiratory depression.
Morphine p.500 is used most widely. Tramadol
hydrochloride p.508 is not as effective in severe pain as
other opioid analgesics. Buprenorphine p.486 may
antagonise the analgesic effect of previously administered
opioids and is generally not recommended. Pethidine
hydrochloride p.506 is generally not recommended for
postoperative pain because it is metabolised to norpethidine
which may accumulate, particularly in renal impairment;
norpethidine stimulates the central nervous system and may
cause convulsions.
Opioids are also given epidurally [unlicensed route] in the
postoperative period but are associated with side-effects
such as pruritus, urinary retention, nausea and vomiting;
respiratory depression can be delayed, particularly with
morphine.
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) can be used to relieve
postoperative pain— consult individual hospital protocols.
Pain management and opioid dependence
Although caution is necessary, patients who are dependent
on opioids or have a history of drug dependence may be
treated with opioid analgesics when there is a clinical need.
Treatment with opioid analgesics in this patient group
should normally be carried out with the advice of specialists.
However, doctors do not require a special licence to
prescribe opioid analgesics to patients with opioid
dependence for relief of pain due to organic disease or injury.
